# service DNS records?
# pod DNS records?


we had 3 node k8s cluster --> with some pods and services --> each node had node name --> and each node had ip adress assign to them.
  # these node name and node ip register in DNS server in the organization

as same as above k8s deployed the same DNS server in cluster with the name of 'KUBE-DNS'
  # in cluster we just focus on pod and servcies in cluster , rather then nodes.
    # then ever the service is craeted the 'hostname = ip address' which provided the access to the application.
      # if you are useing your custome domain spacce, you need to define them to access them.
        #example: curl http://google.com.<namespace>/

        #here is the full defination example how he work?
          # curl http://<hostname>.<namespace>.<type>.<root>.<ip-address>
          # culr http://web-nginx.my-namespace.svc.<cluster.local>.10.10.1.117
